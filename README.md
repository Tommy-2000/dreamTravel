# dreamTravel

Travel booking platform and application consisting of a Flutter front-end for Android, iOS and Web. This Flutter application is combined with a Node.JS back-end with TypeScript to manage authentication and API calls made to Amadeus Travel API's.


## Project Details

This project was developed as a "full-stack" upgrade on the TravelHopper Android project that I initally developed at university and to demonstrate my experience with cross-platform mobile application development as well as back-end development with Node.JS.


## API

Amadeus API's were used with CRUD-based API calls through TypeScript to Create, Read, Update and Delete flight, hotel and travel package data.
